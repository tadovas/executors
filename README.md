# executors
A pretty much useless and naive port of Java executors functionality. As thread pools are primary to preserve spanning threads
in uncontrollable way (and consuming OS resources), goroutines a different (and very lightweight) so there is no need for goroutine pooling I guess.
Anyway it was a good excersice as part of learning go.
